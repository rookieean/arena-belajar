"""
Create a program that performs the following tasks using range():

Print all numbers between 30 to 80 that are divisible by 4
Print the first 8 odd numbers starting from 15
Count backwards from 50 to 10, showing only numbers divisible by 5
Find the product of all numbers from 1 to 30 that are divisible by 3
When printing a number use the following code to print:

print(num, end=", ")
This will not create a new line after the number, instead it will add ,
